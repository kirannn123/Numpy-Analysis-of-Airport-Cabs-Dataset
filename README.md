This project utilizes NumPy to analyze an airport cabs dataset. 
The dataset contains information on cab rides, including ride speed, dates, tips, and drop-off locations. 
With NumPy, key questions such as mean ride speed, February ride counts, high-tip rides, and rides to JFK Airport have been efficiently addressed. 
This analysis offers valuable insights into airport transportation trends.
